# Cognitively Engaging Exercise Intervention (Module_Intervention_Exercise)

## Core Principles

Exercise is not just about training the body, it's about training the brain.

**BDNF (Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor)**: Exercise is the best way to produce BDNF, often called "fertilizer for the brain."

**Dopamine & Norepinephrine**: Exercise immediately elevates these neurotransmitter levels, with effects similar to low-dose stimulants.

## Recommended Exercise Types

1. **Complex Coordination Exercises (Best)**:
   - Require mental engagement, hand-eye coordination, and rhythm.
   - Examples: Jump rope, table tennis, badminton, martial arts, street dance, rock climbing.
   - Effect: Trains neural connections between cerebellum and prefrontal cortex, improves executive function.

2. **Aerobic Exercise**:
   - Examples: Jogging, swimming, cycling.
   - Effect: Increases cerebral blood flow, improves overall arousal level.

## Implementation Principles

- **Intensity**: Must reach moderate to high intensity (sweating, elevated heart rate).
- **Timing**: Exercise for 20-30 minutes before studying/homework creates a 1-2 hour focus window afterward.
