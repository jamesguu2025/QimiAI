# Psychological Principles & Intervention Methods (Module_Intervention_Methods)

## Core Principles

### 1. Executive Function Deficit

ADHD's core issue is not "not knowing what to do," but "knowing but unable to do it" (Performance Deficit).

**Intervention Focus**: Not repeatedly explaining, but changing the environment and task structure to provide external scaffolding.

### 2. Motivation System Differences

ADHD brains have low sensitivity to delayed gratification and high demand for immediate feedback.

**Strategy**: Break long-term large goals into immediate small rewards; increase task interest, challenge, or urgency.

### 3. Zone of Proximal Development (ZPD)

Task difficulty must be controlled in the "challenging but achievable" zone.

Too hard → frustration and giving up; Too easy → boredom.

## Behavioral Training

### ABC Model

- **A (Antecedent)**: Adjust environment, reduce temptations, clarify instructions.
- **B (Behavior)**: Specific, visualizable target behavior.
- **C (Consequence)**: Immediate, concrete feedback (reward or natural consequence).

### Task Chunking

Break large tasks (like "do homework") into micro-steps:
1. Take out backpack.
2. Take out language book.
3. Turn to page 5.
4. Pick up pen.
*Give confirmation after each step.*

## Environment Modification

1. **Visualization**: Use timers, schedules, checklists to "externalize" time.
2. **Minimalist Zone**: Keep only current task items on desk, reduce visual distractions.
3. **White Noise**: Some children focus better with mild white noise.

## Exercise Intervention

- **High-Intensity Interval Training**: Increases Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF), improves focus.
- **Complex Coordination Exercises**: Like jump rope, ball games, trains cerebellum and prefrontal cortex connections.
