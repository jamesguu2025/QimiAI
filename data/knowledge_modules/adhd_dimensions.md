# ADHD 10-Dimensional Framework (Module_ADHD_Dimension)

1. **Neuroscience Dimension**:
   - Core: Executive function, prefrontal cortex, reward system, time blindness.
   - Mechanism: Differences in brain region connectivity and activation affect behavioral control and planning abilities.

2. **Functional Medicine Dimension**:
   - Core: Sleep, blood sugar, nutrition, gut-brain axis, inflammatory response, micronutrients.
   - Mechanism: Physical physiological states directly affect brain function.
   - *Note*: Iron/magnesium/zinc deficiency directly impacts executive function.

3. **Sensory & Motor Dimension**:
   - Core: Vestibular sense, proprioception, bilateral coordination, core strength.
   - Mechanism: Abnormal sensory input processing leads to abnormal behavioral output (e.g., can't sit still = seeking sensory stimulation).

4. **Posture & Body Alignment Dimension**:
   - Core: Body balance, forward head posture, low muscle tone, rounded shoulders, oxygen efficiency.
   - Mechanism: Poor posture affects breathing efficiency and brain oxygenation, which impacts focus.

5. **Family Structure Dimension**:
   - Core: Rules, reinforcement, parental consistency, home-school communication.
   - Mechanism: External environmental structure compensates for internal executive function deficits.

6. **Emotional Regulation Dimension**:
   - Core: Anger outbursts, delayed gratification, self-awareness and sense of security.
   - Mechanism: Amygdala hyperactivation and insufficient prefrontal cortex inhibition lead to the "emotional brain" taking over.

7. **Learning & Executive Skills Dimension**:
   - Core: Task initiation, working memory, motivation system.
   - Mechanism: Knowing what to do but unable to do it (Performance Deficit).

8. **Social Functioning Dimension**:
   - Core: Social cues, rejection sensitive dysphoria (RSD), peer conflicts.
   - Mechanism: Impulsivity and inattention cause missing social signals.

9. **Environment & Stimulation Dimension**:
   - Core: Noise, lighting, spatial clutter, visual distractions.
   - Mechanism: Weaker ability to filter irrelevant stimuli, easily disturbed by environment.

10. **Traditional Chinese Medicine Dimension**:
    - Core: Constitution identification, yin-yang balance, organ function, qi-blood circulation.
    - Mechanism: Understanding mind-body state from a holistic energy and balance perspective.
