# Sensory Integration Training (Module_Intervention_Sensory)

## Core Principles

Many children with ADHD are "hyperactive" because they're **seeking sensory stimulation** (Sensory Seeking), or their attention is scattered due to Sensory Modulation Disorder.

The brain needs appropriate sensory input to maintain arousal state.

## Common Issues & Interventions

1. **Vestibular Sense**:
   - Manifestations: Likes spinning, can't sit still, rocks in chair.
   - Training: Swinging, scooter, trampoline, rolling.

2. **Proprioception**:
   - Manifestations: Clumsy movements, uses too much/too little force, likes squeezing/crashing.
   - Training: Pushing walls, tug-of-war, climbing, weighted walking (e.g., heavy backpack), deep pressure massage.

3. **Tactile Sense**:
   - Manifestations: Picky about clothing tags, doesn't like being touched, or touches things excessively.
   - Training: Playing with sand/mud/water, tactile brush, different texture stimulation.

## Home Training Principles (Sensory Diet)

- **Sensory Diet**: Like eating meals, regularly "feed" the brain sensory stimulation.
- **Between Homework Tasks**: When a child can't sit still, instead of criticizing, do 2 minutes of "proprioceptive activity" (like 20 jumping jacks or wall pushes) to help the brain reset.
