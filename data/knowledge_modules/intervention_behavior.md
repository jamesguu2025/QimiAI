# ADHD Behavioral Intervention Principles (Russell Barkley)

## Core Concept: External Support for Executive Function Deficits

The core issue with ADHD is not "not knowing what to do" (knowledge deficit), but "inability to apply known knowledge" (performance deficit). Therefore, intervention focuses on modifying the environment (Point of Performance), not just lecturing.

## 1. Immediacy Principle

- **Rationale**: Children with ADHD have deficits in time perception (Time Blindness); future consequences have weak influence on current behavior.
- **Implementation**:
  - Consequences (rewards or punishments) must occur **immediately** after the behavior.
  - Don't say "wait until your dad gets home" or "if you behave all week, we'll go somewhere fun this weekend."
  - Use token/point systems to make rewards "visible" and accumulate immediately.

## 2. Frequency Principle

- **Rationale**: Children with ADHD have short motivation maintenance; need high-frequency feedback to sustain behavior.
- **Implementation**:
  - Shorten feedback cycles. Typical children may need praise every 30 minutes; children with ADHD may need it every 5-10 minutes.
  - Task breakdown: Split large tasks into tiny steps, give feedback after each step.

## 3. Salience Principle

- **Rationale**: Weak social reinforcement (like a smile or mild "good job") is often insufficient to penetrate ADHD's attention barrier.
- **Implementation**:
  - Use more exaggerated emotional expressions, physical contact (high-fives, hugs).
  - Use tangible rewards (stickers, tokens, privileges).
  - Reward value must be sufficiently attractive to the child.

## 4. 3:1 Golden Ratio (Positives Before Negatives)

- **Rationale**: Children with ADHD are chronically in negative feedback loops due to behavioral issues, leading to learned helplessness or oppositional defiance.
- **Implementation**:
  - Before giving 1 punishment or criticism, ensure you've given at least 3 genuine praises or affirmations.
  - This "emotional bank account" is the foundation for subsequent discipline to be effective.
  - Focus on "exceptions": Catch the child in rare good moments and heavily reinforce (Catch them being good).

## 5. Anticipation Principle

- **Rationale**: Prevention is better than firefighting after the fact.
- **Implementation**:
  - **Before entering situations**: Before entering challenging situations (like supermarket, restaurant, homework time), stop and have the child repeat the rules (2-3 simple rules) and rewards/consequences.
  - **Visualization**: Write rules on cards or draw them, place where child can see them.
